# 🧠 aiproject — House Price Prediction Model

This project aims to **predict the selling price of a house** based on various property and location-related features using **machine learning techniques**. It demonstrates the complete workflow of a supervised regression problem — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate house prices based on key features such as:

* 🏡 Square footage (living area)
* 🛏️ Number of bedrooms
* 🚿 Number of bathrooms
* 📍 Location (city, neighborhood, zip code, etc.)
* 🏗️ Year built and renovation details
* 🌳 Lot size and overall condition
* 🏬 Nearby amenities and other market indicators

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather housing data from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle, Zillow, or synthetic dataset).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize relationships between house prices and various features.
4. **Model Development** – Train regression models such as:

   * Linear Regression
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
5. **Model Evaluation** – Assess performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
6. **Deployment (Optional)** – Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time price predictions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Colab, GitHub, Streamlit (optional)

---

## 📊 Expected Outcome

An accurate and explainable model that helps predict housing prices and provides **valuable insights** for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Integrate geospatial data for location-based insights.
* Add feature importance visualization for model interpretability.
* Deploy as a web app or REST API.
